# online-store-analysis

this project aims to show meaningful insights for an online store to understand its problems and solve them and find several strategies to increase sales

For this project, I built a dashboard using Power Bi to show the quantity and total sales and the number of customers and orders monthly, daily, yearly, and in a quarter of a year.

I also showed the quantity each hour to know the momentum so that we can post more in this hour

 

Firstly, we need to transform data so we split the date from time and fixed the time 

and showed the day in a split column

I removed all null values and with some transformation processes the data was ready to show them in a report
